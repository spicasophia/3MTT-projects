# Assignment 1


## How I went about the project
1. I went to vscode.dev on my mobile phone to access the mobile web version of Visual Studio Code for the task
2. I connected to a repo I created on my GitHub account
3. I created the index.html file inside the repsitory directory.
4. In the index.html I wrote the code, following the **task breakdown**, ensuring each section is duly followed and every tag is properly opened and closed likewise. 
5. After which I saved the file and added this ReadMe to the GitHub repsitory.
